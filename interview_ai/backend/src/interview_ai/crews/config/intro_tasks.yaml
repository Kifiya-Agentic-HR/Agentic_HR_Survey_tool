    Create a personalized welcome message for an exit interview that includes:
      - The employee's name (from User Info)
      - Their job title (from Job Title)
      - A warm, respectful greeting that sets a comfortable tone
      - A brief explanation of the purpose of the exit interview (e.g., to gather honest feedback, understand their experience, and improve the workplace)
      - Reassure the employee that their responses are confidential and valued
      - End with an open-ended kickoff question like: "To get us started, could you tell me a bit about your experience working here?"

    Guidelines:
      - Use a calm, conversational, and professional toneâ€”no corporate jargon or robotic phrasing.
      - Avoid overly formal language. Speak as if you're having a relaxed conversation with a colleague.
      - Keep it short, natural, and sincere.

    Provided Inputs:

    Employee Name:
      {name}

    User Info:
      {user_info}
    
    Job Title:
      {role_info}

  expected_output: >
    The output should be a JSON object with the following structure:
    
    {
      "state": "welcome",
      "text": "Personalized welcome message for the exit interview."
    }

    Do NOT include any extra formatting like markdown or code blocks.
